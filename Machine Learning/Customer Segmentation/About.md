The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Data analysts play a key role in unlocking these in-depth insights, and segmenting the customers to better serve them. We will first run cohort analysis to understand customer trends. We will then learn how to build easy to interpret customer segments. On top of that, We will prepare the segments We created, making them ready for machine learning. Finally, We will make the segments more powerful with k-means clustering.
